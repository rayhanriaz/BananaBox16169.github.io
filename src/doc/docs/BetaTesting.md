# Our Beta Testing 

Having much experience with the existing Control Hub, we applied to test the new FIRST robotics robot system. Fortunately, we were **selected among many appliances around the world** to Alpha Test the new control core and motion systems (1 of 3 in New England), working along FIRST HQ staff member, **Danny Diaz**. This included the new Systemcore, Motioncore, A301 Actuator, and Battery Pack.

## SHOWCASE

After our beta testing, we were invited to showcase it all at the **New England Premier Event** (NEI). A competition where many great teams compete to test, learn, and grow.
