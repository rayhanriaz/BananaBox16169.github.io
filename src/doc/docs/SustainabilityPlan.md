# Our Sustainability Plan

## Team Continuity

Recruit → Train → Lead → Mentor → Alumni Support

In Team Continuity, experienced members mentor new members. We are also to reach out to Alumni for additional mentorship.

## Knowledge Transfer

Learn → Apply → Improve → Teach → Share

In Knowledge Transfer, we create an Engineering Notebook, CAD libraries, and Code templates. We also teach skills and show resources to new members.

## Funding Stability

Fundraising → Robot + Outreach

In Funding Stability, we station concession stands, push for Mission FTC-Possible, and recycle parts. Our money goes into the DECODE robot and outreach.


## Recruitment 

Outreach → Youth + Professionals → Team Members + Mentors

In Recruitment, we engage with young learners and professionals. We develop and grow as a team and mentors.

## Resource Stability

Shared Space → Maintained Tools → Safe Training → Consistent Build Seasons

In Resource Stability, we maintain an efficient and organized environment. We also train to use tools and parts necessarily and safely.

## Succession

Set Goals → Execute Season → Measure Results → Improve Next Year

In Succession, we set S.M.A.R.T goals every season. In addition, we evaluate and improve team processes.
