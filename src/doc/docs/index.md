## Our Team Goals

ROBOT PERFORMANCE GOAL: By the FTC World Championship, we will reliably score at least 18 artifacts autonomously and consistently cycle (score and reset) artifacts during the driver-controlled phase.

OUTREACH GOAL: By the end of the DECODE season, we will have spread FIRST robotics to hundreds of young learners and professionals, through hands-on workshops and online networking.
